# ADG Algorithms
#### This is a collection of algorithms that I've implemented as part of my exam preparation for the Algorithms and Data Structures and Graph Theory (ADG) during my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

<summary><h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2></summary>
To use the algorithms you can use the <kbd>main()</kbd> in this class :: <kbd>src/main/java/adg/sorting/Main.java</kbd><br>
The sorting algorithms will produce the different states that occured while performing the algorithm.<br>
for example ::<br>
<kbd>{12, 13, 24, 33, 20, 17, 29, 19, 11, 8}</kbd> with <kbd>merge sort</kbd> will produce the following output ::<br>
<pre>
{
{12, 13, 24, 33, 20, 17, 29, 19, 11, 8},
{12, 13},
{12, 13, 24},
{20, 33},
{12, 13, 20, 24, 33},
{17, 29},
{17, 19, 29},
{8, 11},
{8, 11, 17, 19, 29},
{8, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 24, 29, 33}
}
